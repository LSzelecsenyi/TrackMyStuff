# Strict backend

Standalone Spring Boot service for Strict. It is not part of the Android Gradle build.

Local PostgreSQL listens on `127.0.0.1:5433` so it does not take Puff's usual port and is not published on every interface. The database name and user are `strict`. The password `strict` is a local default only.

Production must run with the `prod` profile. That profile has no database defaults. Set:

- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
- `SERVER_PORT` when the process should not use `8082`
- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`

## Start PostgreSQL

From `backend/`:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Run the backend

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

On Windows:

```shell
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

## Health

```shell
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/health
```

`GET /api/v1/health` returns HTTP 200 and `{"status":"UP"}`. It does not require authentication. Deployment checks should use this path. Actuator is not on the classpath.

## Tests

```shell
./gradlew test
```

Integration tests start PostgreSQL 16 with Testcontainers. Docker must be running.

## CORS

No CORS policy is configured. The Android app does not need browser CORS. The future admin UI at `https://admin.strictworkout.eu` will need an explicit allowed origin. Do not allow `*`.

## Time

Absolute timestamps use UTC for JDBC sessions, Hibernate binding, and JSON. That is not a business timezone. Calendar dates and a user's enrollment zone are later work.
